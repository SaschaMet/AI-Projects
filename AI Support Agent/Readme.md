# AI Support Agent

This project aims to develop an AI-powered support agent that can classify and prioritize customer support tickets. The agent uses machine learning models to analyze ticket descriptions and assign appropriate priorities and departments.

## Datasets

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle:

- [Email Ticket Text German Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tobiasbueck/email-ticket-text-german-classification)

## Usage

You have to run a local LM-Studio instance with a PHI-4 model to use this project as is. You can find the instructions to run LM-Studio [here](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/api/rest-api).
You can also change the model to any other model that you have access to or use an OpenAI model by changing the `model` parameter and the `base_url` as well as the `api_key`.
